# SemEval-Task6-CS408

## Offensive Tweets Classification - SemEval 2019 - Codalab Challenge

### Creator of Project :
Yagyansh Bagri


### Proposed Implementation : 
The Implementation proposed during this project relies on the GloVe word embedding, strong data processing and different networks such as Logistic Regression and Convolutional Neural Networks.

### Description of the Project :
The following description was taken on Codalab : [Link](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20011#learn_the_details)

### Overall Summary of Research: 
Offensive language is pervasive in social media. Individuals frequently take advantage of the perceived anonymity of computer-mediated communication, using this to engage in behavior that many of them would not consider in real life. Online communities, social media platforms, and technology companies have been investing heavily in ways to cope with offensive language to prevent abusive behavior in social media..

In **OffensEval** we break down offensive content into three sub-tasks taking the type and target of offenses into account.

**Sub-tasks:**
1. **Sub-task A** - Offensive language identification
2. **Sub-task B** - Automatic categorization of offense types
3. **Sub-task C** - Offense target identification.

### Data: 
The data is retrieved from SemEval Task 6 Competition. The testing and traininga data are available in the "OLID_2019" tab. 


### Description of the Content of this Repo: 
This repository contains the final submission of the project.
